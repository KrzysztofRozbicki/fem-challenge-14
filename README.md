## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

So far this challenge was with most messed up and changed typography I have ever seen. Beside that
it was very simple and a good exercise for CSS grid.

### Continued development

I would love to know if it is OK to change the design if it clearly is kind of mess up up or should
i stick to designer/ graphic plan and design. u look back on this project in the future.\*\*
